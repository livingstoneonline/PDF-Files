<lb/>Portions of the evidence as afore quoted
<lb/>leave not the smallest doubt as to the fatal

<lb/>to be very winding - they went up <measure>300 miles</measure>
<lb/>which may mean <measure>100 <supplied cert="high">miles</supplied></measure> in a straight line
<lb/>the <persName>Baron</persName> was very haughty in dealing with
<lb/>the <orgName>natives</orgName> and never lost an opportunity
<lb/>of <choice><orig>shewing</orig><reg>showing</reg></choice> his contempt for them - He
<lb/>was moreover somewhat stingy in small
<lb/>matters - the <persName><term type="occupation">Doctor</term></persName> &amp; <persName><term type="occupation">Artist</term></persName> were very amiable
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><persName>Schickh</persName></add> <persName>Von <w>Schi<subst><del>ift</del><add place="over-text">ckh</add></subst></w></persName> was very imperious shouting
<lb/>and roaring and cuffing the
<lb/><term type="occupation"><orgName>native</orgName> sailors</term> all day long as if he had a lot 
<lb/>of <term type="nationality">Austrians</term> under him. He got into a
<lb/>rage with the <orgName>natives</orgName> when giving evidence
<lb/>and by his vociferations confused them
<lb/>The <bibl><persName>Baron</persName>'s letters</bibl> were filled with praise 
<lb/>of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Juba</geogName></placeName> &amp; country and abuse of the <orgName>natives</orgName>
<lb/>He had quarreled with every one here. When
<lb/>asked to go to church he replied that he would
<lb/>not go because the <persName><term type="occupation">bishop</term></persName> prayed for <persName><term type="occupation">Sultan</term>
<lb/>Majid</persName> and he as a knight was bound to
<lb/>extirpate all <term type="nationality">Turks</term> and infidels - This was
<lb/>told me by the <persName><term type="occupation">bishop</term></persName>'s <persName><term type="occupation">chaplain</term></persName> - He
<lb/>seems to have carried things with a high
<lb/>hand - After some altercation with the

<lb/>hand in token of reconciliation and 
<lb/>friendship - The <persName>Baron</persName> thrust it away -
<lb/>contemptuously and by this act probably
<lb/>sealed his own fate - We shall probably
<lb/>never hear the other side of the question
<lb/>from the evidence of these <term type="occupation">sailors</term> as quoted 
<lb/>above it seems that lying was practised by
<lb/>both the <persName>Baron</persName> &amp; <persName>Von Schift</persName> - Ten to one the
<lb/><persName><term type="occupation">chief</term></persName> <persName>Hajee Ali</persName> &amp; people knew perfectly all that
<lb/>took place at the ship - the lies would to him

<lb/><p>The process of depopulation to which I have

<lb/>those who escape usually die of starvation -
<lb/>This process is identical with that of which
<lb/>we formerly saw so much in the hands of the

<lb/>about it without a painful apprehension
<lb/>that to persons at a distance I must appear
<lb/>guilty of exaggeration - But I beg your Lordship
<lb/>to remember that whenever my statements
<lb/>have been tested on the sport they have been found
<lb/>within and not beyond the truth - Even the
<lb/>grand <placeName><geogName type="waterfall">Victoria falls</geogName></placeName> were put down at less
<lb/>than half their size - It was ignorance of this

<lb/>who was always honest bringing up <orgName>his men</orgName>, and

<lb/>they knew to be a sham - to reveal their

<lb/>wholesale plunder did not occur to my

<lb/>to some underground storerooms of the

<lb/>the stores?" He replied "these are all we have

<lb/>without cause, and asked him why
<lb/>he was doing so - He replied "To dry it" - 
<lb/>there was no moisture about <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">it</add> - <seg type="weather">the climate

<lb/>that remained, and said that was all we
<lb/>had - offering again to pay for all
<lb/>he had given away - This state of matters
<lb/>was so astounding, that I thought that

<lb/>I had thought of myself as able to live on

<lb/>We had only the disastrous experience of

<lb/>during the time the plundering took place -
<lb/><persName>Baines</persName> had got a hold of it and entered

<lb/><p>The <orgName>Mission</orgName> was now under  <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Procter</persName> the

<lb/>and the <orgName>freed <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> from the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>, in hatred of <!-- geog: Cape Colony -->
<lb/>men so much braver than themselves, told
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> that the <placeName><settlement type="village"><term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> village</settlement></placeName> was

<lb/>wives, and in fear five women were given.
<lb/>The <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> not knowing the language
<lb/>had to use <orgName>their own people</orgName> as <term type="occupation">interpreters</term>,
<lb/>these consisted of <orgName>freed <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> from the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>,
<lb/>and <orgName>freed <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term></orgName> &amp; <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> from the

<lb/>plurality of wives openly, the others had them
<lb/>secretly and lied to the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to screen
<lb/>themselves - On enquiring into the matter
<lb/>I found that the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> wives of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>

<lb/>so they were led to believe what was indeed

<lb/>then it was that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Procter</persName>'s hut caught fire
<lb/>from his candle in the evening &amp; being like

<lb/>who thought that the <orgName>Mission</orgName> was attacked
<lb/>and flew at once, armed to the rescue -</p>
<lb/><p>A season of confusion had followed
<lb/>the flight of the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> from the
<lb/>highlands - the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> were accused by
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> of "murdering &amp; plundering

<lb/><date when="1866">1866</date> I paid for and despatched a stock of

<lb/>who about and very between this &amp; <placeName><settlement type="town">Ujiji</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>stopped the caravan ten days while he plundered

<lb/>out of 200 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> of fine dear beads all were sold
<lb/>off for <orgName>slaves</orgName> and ivory by the person selected
<lb/>by <persName>Ludha Damji</persName> - I refer to these wholesale

<lb/>and all the <orgName>Banians</orgName> the statement was made

<lb/>of <persName>Ludha</persName>'s plausible fables that all my <unclear>lowly</unclear>

<lb/>I did find <date when="1872-02-18">two days ago</date> a good quantity of

<lb/>naturally conclude that all <orgName>cutchees</orgName> may
<lb/>safely be entrusted with the possession of
<lb/><orgName>slaves</orgName>, but I have been forced to see that
<lb/>those who shrink from killing a <term type="insect">flea</term> or
<lb/><term type="insect">mosquito</term> are virutally the worst <orgName>cannibals</orgName>
<lb/>in all <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> - the <orgName><term type="tribe">Manyema</term> <orgName>cannibals</orgName></orgName>
<lb/>among whom I spent nearly two years
<lb/>are innocents compared with our 
<lb/>protected <orgName><orgName>Banian</orgName> fellow subjects</orgName>.
<lb/>By then <orgName><orgName>Arab</orgName> <term type="occupation">agents</term></orgName> they compass the
<lb/>destruction of more human lives
<lb/>for their <orgName>flesh pots</orgName> in ten - and 
<lb/>could the <term type="nationality">Indian</term> gentlemen who oppose
<lb/>the <orgName>anti slave trade</orgName> policy of the <orgName>Foreign
<lb/>office</orgName>, but witness the horrid deeds
<lb/>done by the <orgName><orgName>Banian</orgName> <term type="occupation">agents</term></orgName>, they would
<lb/>be foremost in decreeing that every
<lb/><orgName>cutchee</orgName> found guilty of direct or indirect
<lb/><orgName>slaving</orgName> should forthwith be shipped
<lb/>back to <placeName><country>India</country></placeName>, if not to the <placeName><geogName type="island">Andeman

<lb/>as he cannot trust his <orgName><term type="faith">Moslem</term>

<lb/>seem to have no religion worthy of the

<lb/>religion and morality are completely
<lb/>disjoined - Different opinions have

<lb/>presented to <orgName>Parliament</orgName> <add place="above"><date when="1865">1865</date></add> contains no
<lb/>such mistake - He states that while the
<lb/>presence of the squadron has had some
<lb/>share in suppressing the <orgName>slave trade</orgName>
<lb/>the result is mainly due to the existence
<lb/>of the settlements - this is supported by
<lb/>the fact that even in those least visited
<lb/>by men of war, it has been as effectually
<lb/>suppressed as in those which have
<lb/>been their most constant resort - the
<lb/>moral element which has proved
<lb/>beneficial all round the settlements
<lb/>is mainly due to the teachings of the
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> - I would carefully
<lb/>avoid anything like boasting over
